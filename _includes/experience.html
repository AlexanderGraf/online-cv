                        <p style="text-align:justify">As a Senior Staff Data Scientist, I focus on proof of concept analytics development with direct client collaboration.  My role offers a mixture of engagements of varying duration.  The shorter projects are typically an evaluation of the feasibility of producing a solution to a client's challenges given the available data.  This allows a quickly growing and diverse exposure to the variety of challenges our client's face and the aspirations they have.  The longer projects require a more robust analytic development and typically follow more closely the experimentation, development and deployment process.</p> 

                        <p style="text-align:justify">During this period I have developed 3 solutions to problems in 3 industrial domains: risk of pneumonia health ranking for beef cattle (4 months), root cause analysis of hypoxic pilots in FA-18 Navy fighter jets (6 months) and anomaly detection and isolation in Army transport vehicles (1.5 months).</p> 

                        <p style="text-align:justify">1) One of the leading killers of beef cattle in the United States is bovine pneumonia typically acquired during extended and cramped transportation.  Early identification and treatment of the ailment is vital to an optimal feed to beef conversion.  A further benefit to identifying sick animals is a targeted application of antibiotics.  This not only reduces the cost but avoids unnecessary dosing.  A rolling window ensemble binary classification method (random forest) allowed a temporal probabilisitc ranking for identifying cattle at risk.  This daily list can help cowboys identify those animals from sometimes thousands that they are responsible for.</p>  

                        <p style="text-align:justify">2) Navy pilots have recently been experiencing potentially life threatening side effects from flying F18 fighter jets.  The cause is unclear, but by definition of the hypoxic and hyperoxic symptoms, it must be related to either the quality or quantity of available breathing air.  As part of a team of 3, we produced a collection of potential causes for subject matter experts in the Navy to evaluate.  Our approaches were a mixture of standard but targeted hypothesis testing between healthy and unhealthy populations, partial dependence plotting from extensive feature creation, text summarization of pilot descriptions (LDA/Gensim), targeted modeling of the ventilation system using a comparison of upstream and downstream predictions from shallow neural networks.  We also attempted various attempts methods of supervised classification with the goal of investigating the driving factors during an event using local interprettable models (LIME) to deduce potential causes.  However, since the onset of symptoms could range from immediate to a few days after the incident, supervised classifiers were not generalizable.  The validity of our recommendations are being explored by Navy personnel.</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify">3) Army transport vehicles are very expensive to operate and maintain.  In order to reduce their cost and ensure asset performance, they want to move away from scheduled maintenance towards a more proactive and optimal approach to maintenance and full updating of these assets.  This work leverages the succes of our unsupervised anomaly detection framework that we developed for commercial jet engines and is described below.  A per vehicle temporally resolved anomaly score as well as a feature ranking are provided as outputs.  This work is slated to be part of a larger fleet wide monitoring and planning tool.</p>   

                        <p style="text-align:justify">Further, I was able to evaluate the feasability of analytic creation for 3 other potential projects (depending upon client interest). These include, shipping port crane failure prediction (1 month), passenger train door failure risk ranking (2 weeks) and finally, the identification of product recipe operator training opportunities for manufacturing in the skin care sector (1 week).</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify">Other additional duties include junior staff mentoring as well as the development of reusable analytic tools.  These tools include a feature creation tool kit for internal use and methods of product viability related to data validation and reconcilation or, more clearly, sensor failure detection.</p>

                            <div class="time">06-2013 to 02-2016</div>

                        <p style="text-align:justify">During this introductory period to industry, I contributed heavily to fault detection and isolation and remaining useful life prediction for commerical jet engines.  By design, engine faults in the commercial aviation industry are rare.  Therefore, applicable analytic techniques are primarily unsupervised, semi-supervised or transfer-based in nature.</p>  

                        <p style="text-align:justify">The few but more abundant faults are typically mundane yet important for maintenance scheduling versus cataclysmic failure.  The identification of these faults using semi-supervised learning and change point detection allows a lead time for maintenance planning.  Concept drift, class imbalance and asset healing from partial maintenance activities is a continual challenge during analytic development.  Portions of this work went on to be used in the GE Aviation jet engine monitoring analytics suite.  The work was also captured in an internal GE report.</p>  

                        <p style="text-align:justify">Methods for engine maintenance planning were also developed for new product introduction, using transfer learning and domain adaptation from a similar fleet of engines to new engine test data.  We leveraged approaches both requiring no labeled events (MMDE) as well as boosting on a few as they become available (Tradaboost).  This combination allows maintenance planning to bridge the gap during the transition from old product to new.</p> 

                        <p style="text-align:justify">As a result of the fact that there are, by design, few failures in industrial equipment, unsupervised anomaly detection with feature importance is a highly valuable tool to have available.  As a team of 3, we developed a reusable framework to do this relatively easily.  The approach combined preprocessing, model training, validation and testing into one pipeline.  The result is an anomaly score as a function of time and a breakdown of the contributing features at each time step.  Not knowing the signature of the anomalies required an ensemble of techniques, which look for various types of anomalies independently.  These include, cosine distance to a learned manifold (Matrix Sketching SVD), temporally based distance (Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model over a rolling temporal window of the time series covariance), a non-distance based isolation method (temporal Isolation Forest) and an information based (temporally changing Graphical Granger Causality) approach.  All of them (except for Isolation Forest) return a score which can be broken down into contributing portions allowing not only detection, but isolation, offering some insight into potential causality.  This is highly valuable for maintenance planning and proactive fault avoidance.</p>        

                        <p style="text-align:justify">In addition to the work in commerical aviation, I was a leading member of a team of 6 to develop an early warning solution for power generating turbines and heat exchangers for a large chemical corporation.  Our work augmented legacy GE monitoring and reactive analytics with predictive capability.  The output of the autoassociative legacy analytic acted as an input to the predictive ARIMAX model.  This work was part of a larger offering making this analytic available to their fleet of industrial equipment in general.</p>
