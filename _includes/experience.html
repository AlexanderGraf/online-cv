                        <p style="text-align:justify">As a Senior Staff Data Scientist, I focus on proof of concept analytics development with direct client collaboration.  My role offers a mixture of engagements of varying duration.  The shorter projects are typically an evaluation of the feasibility of producing a solution to a clients challenges given the available data.  This allows a quickly growing and diverse exposure to the variey of challenges our clients face and the aspirations they have.  The longer projects require a more robust anlaytic development and typically follow more closely the experimentation, development and deployment process.</p> 

                        <p style="text-align:justify">During this period I have developed 3 solutions to problems in 3 industrial domains, risk of pneumonia ranking for beef cattle (4 months), root cause analysis of hypoxic pilots in FA-18 Navy fighter jets (6 months) and anomaly detection and isolation in Army transport vehicles (1.5 months).</p> 

                        <p style="text-align:justify">One of the leading killers of beef cattle in the united states is pneumonia which is typically acquired during extended and cramped transportation.  Early identification and treatment of the ailment is vital to an optimal corn to beef conversion.  A further benefit to identifying sick animals a targeted application of antibiotics.  This not only reduces the antibiotic cost but avoids unnecessary dosing.  A rolling window ensemble binary classification method (random forest) allowed a temporal probabilisitc ranking for identifying cattle at risk.</p>  

                        <p style="text-align:justify">Navy pilots have recently been experiencing potentially life threatening side effects from flying F18 fighter jets.  The cause is unclear but by definition of the hypoxic and hyperoxic symptoms must be related to either the quality or quantity of available breathing air.  As a part of a team of 3, we produced a collection of potential causes for subject matter experts in the Navy to evaluate.  Our approaches were a mixture of standard hypothesis testing between healthy and unhealthy popluations, partial dependence plotting from extensive feature creation, text summarization of pilot descriptions (LDA/Gensim), targeted modeling of the ventilation system using a comparison of upstream and downstream predictions from shallow neural networks.  We also attempted various attempts (methods - random forest, SVM and time scales) at classification with the goal of investigating the driving factors using local interprettable models (LIME) to deduce potential causes.  However, since the onset of symptoms could range from immediate to a few days after the incident, supervised methods were not generalizable.  The validity of our recommendations are being explored by Navy personnel.</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify">Army transport vehicles are very expensive to operate and maintain.  In order to reduce their cost and ensure asset performance they want to move away from scheduled maintenance to a more proactive and optimal approach towards maintenance and full replacement of these assets.  This work leverages the succes of our unsupervised anomaly detection framework that we developed for commercial jet engines and described below.  A per vehicle temporally resolved anomaly score as well as a feature ranking are provided as outputs.  This is intended to eb part of a larger fleet wide monitoring and planning tool.</p>   

                        <p style="text-align:justify">Further, I was able to evaluate the feasability of analytic creation for 3 other potential future projects. These include, shipping port crane failure prediction (1 month), passenger train door failure risk ranking (2 weeks) and finally, the identification of product recipe operator training opportunities for manufacturing in the skin care sector (1 week).</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify">Other additional duties include junior staff mentoring as well as the development of reusable analytic tools.  These include a feature creation tool kit for internal use and methods of product viability related to data validation and reconcilation - sensor failure detection.</p>

                            <div class="time">06-2013 to 02-2016</div>

                        <p style="text-align:justify">During this introductory period to industry I contributed heavily to fault detection and isolation and remaining useful life prediction in commerical jet engines.  By design engine faults in the commercial aviation industry are rare.  Therefore, analytic techniques are primarily unsupervised, semisupervised or transfer based in nature.</p>  

                        <p style="text-align:justify">The few but more abundant faults are typically mundane in nature and important for maintenace scheduling versus cataclysmic failure.  The identification of these faults using semisupervised learning and change point detection in the best case allows a lead time for maintenance planning.  Concept drift, class imbalance and asset healing from partial maintenance activities is a continual challenge during analytic development (i.e. it is a challenge to identify healthy populations for model development).  Portions of this work went on to be used in the GE Aviation jet engine monitoring analytics suite.  The work was also captured in an internal GE report.</p>  

                        <p style="text-align:justify">Methods for engine maintenance planning were also developed for new product introduction using transfer learning and domain adaptation from a similar fleet of engines to new engine test data.  We leveraged approaches both requiring no labeled events (MMDE) as well as boosting on a few (Tradaboost).  This combination allows maintenance planning to bringe the gap during the transition from old product to new.</p> 

                        <p style="text-align:justify">As a result of the fact that there are by design few failures in industrial equipment, unsupervised anomaly detection with feature importance is a highly valuable tool to have.  As a team of three we developed a reusable framework to do this.  The approach combined preprocessing, model training, validation and testing in one pipeline.  The result is an anomaly score as a function of time and a breakdown of the contributing feaatures point by point.  Not knowing the signature of the anomalies required an ensemble of techniques which look for various types of anomalies.  These include, general projection and distance based (Matrix Sketching SVD with a cosine distance), temporally based distance (Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model over a rolling temporal window of the time series covariance), a non distance based isolation method (Isolation Forest) and an information based (temporally changing Graphical Granger Causality) approach.  All of them (except for isolation forest) return a score which can be broken down into contributing portions allowing not only detection but isolation to offer some insight into causality.  This is highly valuable for maintenance and proactive fault avoidance.</p>        

                        <p style="text-align:justify">In addition to the work in commerical aviation, I was a leading member of a team of 6 to develop a early warning solution for power generating turbines and heat exchangers for a large chemical corporation.  This augmented legacy GE monitoring and reactive analytics with predictive capability.  Our portion of this undertaking was part of a larger offering to make this analytic available to their fleet of industrial equipment in general.</p>
