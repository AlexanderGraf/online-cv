                    <p style="text-align:justify">Always of interest to me is finding alternative uses for mature and proven analytics.  This often means taking an approach in one field and applying it in another.  For example, I am currently exploring a method to use the idea of distributed word representations, but in a time series setting.  Time series can be converted to text using SAX, which opens up the world of NLP and text mining techniques for consideration.  The challenge is to adapt this historically univariate approach to a multivariate setting.  One way to do this is to capture the interactions of the signals using covariance or an empirical mutual information (although non trivial) and then apply something like word2vec or GLoVe to each univariate value.  Another approach is to learn the word vectors across sensors for a given time point.  The order of sensors matter in this case, but as long as you are consistent between training and testing, there should be no problem.  You could also imagine shuffling the column order and using some ensemble of the result (the same random seed should be used between training and testing). The value is that one can leverage an unabeled data set (which are typically easily had) for pretraining for use in a supervised model with many fewer labels.  This is often the setting for high value asset failure as mentioned many times above, but is applicable in general for detecting rare events. This is a work in progress.</p>
